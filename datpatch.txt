         DATPATCH is a quick and dirty utility I wrote to patch the 
         current date-time into an executable module.  
         
         The company I work for uses SNA LU 0 for file transfer.  
         When we send maintenance code, the date-time stamp on the 
         .EXE file is changed during transmission and the file size 
         is rounded up to a 256-byte multiple.  This has caused 
         problems in determining which module was actually in use at 
         the site.  So I devised a quick method of applying the date-
         time to a string imbedded in the .EXE module.  I included a 
         string constant, then wrote a small program to locate that 
         string and replace it with the current system date and time.

         In order to use the utility, perform the following steps:

            1) Include the following string in your program:
                
                   char str[] = "COMPILED ON MM/DD/YY - HH:MM";



            2) Add the following command after the compile and link:

                   DATPATCH program.exe

               where "program.exe" is the .EXE to be modified.



         This implementation is not the most creative or efficient 
         but it works.  It is written in ANSI C, and should be 
         portable to most C environments.  The version included in 
         this package is already compiled using the MAKEIT.BAT and is 
         linked as a family-mode program.
